#You are given a string s consisting only of the characters '(' and ')'. Your task is to determine the minimum number of parentheses (either '(' or ')') that must be inserted at any positions to make the string s a valid parentheses string.
class Solution:
    def minParentheses(self, s):
        balance = 0
        additions = 0
        
        for ch in s:
            if ch == '(':
                balance += 1
            else:
                if balance > 0:
                    balance -= 1
                else:
                    additions += 1
        
        return additions + balance
